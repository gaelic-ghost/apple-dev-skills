# SpeakSwiftlyServer

Swift executable package for a localhost HTTP server that exposes `SpeakSwiftlyCore` over a small, app-friendly API.

## Overview

This repository is the Swift-native sibling to `../speak-to-user-server`. It uses [Hummingbird](https://github.com/hummingbird-project/hummingbird) to host a localhost macOS HTTP service with in-memory job tracking and server-sent events, while delegating speech, profile management, and worker lifecycle to the typed `SpeakSwiftlyCore` runtime.

### Motivation

The target is a thin Swift service that a forthcoming macOS app can install and manage as a LaunchAgent without needing a separate Python runtime. Matching the existing Python server’s HTTP contract keeps the app-facing integration stable while moving the runtime path fully into Swift.

That means this package intentionally stays narrow: Hummingbird for HTTP, `SpeakSwiftlyCore` for speech and profile operations, and a small amount of server state to translate typed worker events into job snapshots and SSE replay.

## Setup

Build the package with SwiftPM:

```bash
swift build
```

Run the test suite:

```bash
swift test
```

## Usage

Run the server locally:

```bash
swift run SpeakSwiftlyServer
```

The service binds to `127.0.0.1:7337` by default and supports these environment variables:

- `APP_NAME`
- `APP_ENVIRONMENT`
- `APP_HOST`
- `APP_PORT`
- `APP_SSE_HEARTBEAT_SECONDS`
- `APP_COMPLETED_JOB_TTL_SECONDS`
- `APP_COMPLETED_JOB_MAX_COUNT`
- `APP_JOB_PRUNE_INTERVAL_SECONDS`

The current HTTP surface is:

- `GET /healthz`
- `GET /readyz`
- `GET /status`
- `GET /profiles`
- `POST /profiles`
- `DELETE /profiles/{profile_name}`
- `POST /speak`
- `POST /speak/background`
- `GET /jobs/{job_id}`
- `GET /jobs/{job_id}/events`

`POST /speak`, `POST /speak/background`, `POST /profiles`, and `DELETE /profiles/{profile_name}` all return job metadata immediately. `POST /speak` uses the direct `speak_live` runtime path, while `POST /speak/background` uses the queued `speak_live_background` path and records the extra acknowledgement event before terminal completion. Progress, worker status changes, acknowledgements, and terminal results are exposed through `GET /jobs/{job_id}/events` as SSE.

The route surface now matches the Python sibling at the endpoint level. The remaining parity work is narrower: re-checking response payload details and deciding whether any server-local translation code should disappear now that `SpeakSwiftlyCore` is more expressive.

## Development

The executable entrypoint lives in [`Sources/SpeakSwiftlyServer/SpeakSwiftlyServer.swift`](/Users/galew/Workspace/SpeakSwiftlyServer/Sources/SpeakSwiftlyServer/SpeakSwiftlyServer.swift). The server itself stays intentionally small:

- [`ServerApp.swift`](/Users/galew/Workspace/SpeakSwiftlyServer/Sources/SpeakSwiftlyServer/ServerApp.swift) wires Hummingbird routes.
- [`ServerState.swift`](/Users/galew/Workspace/SpeakSwiftlyServer/Sources/SpeakSwiftlyServer/ServerState.swift) tracks worker readiness, cached profiles, job history, SSE subscribers, and retention.
- [`ServerRuntimeBridge.swift`](/Users/galew/Workspace/SpeakSwiftlyServer/Sources/SpeakSwiftlyServer/ServerRuntimeBridge.swift) keeps the runtime boundary thin around `SpeakSwiftlyCore`.
- [`ServerModels.swift`](/Users/galew/Workspace/SpeakSwiftlyServer/Sources/SpeakSwiftlyServer/ServerModels.swift) defines request and response payloads.

The design is deliberately direct. Adding extra wrappers, managers, or intermediate layers here would be easy, but it would also be the kind of unnecessary complexity that makes a small localhost service harder to reason about, so the server is kept close to the typed runtime API on purpose.

## Verification

Current baseline checks:

```bash
swift build
swift test
```

The current automated suite covers configuration parsing, foreground and background job completion semantics, in-memory retention and pruning, SSE replay and heartbeat behavior, route-level health, profile, and job lifecycle responses against a controlled typed runtime, plus an opt-in live end-to-end path against a real `SpeakSwiftlyCore` runtime:

```bash
SPEAKSWIFTLYSERVER_E2E=1 swift test --filter SpeakSwiftlyServerE2ETests
```

There is also a second opt-in live pass that exercises the actual playback path instead of the silent playback controller. It still drives the full localhost HTTP surface, but it additionally waits for the runtime's structured `playback_engine_ready`, `playback_started`, and `playback_finished` log events:

```bash
SPEAKSWIFTLYSERVER_E2E=1 SPEAKSWIFTLYSERVER_E2E_REAL_PLAYBACK=1 swift test --filter SpeakSwiftlyServerE2ETests
```

If you want the underlying playback trace logs too, add `SPEAKSWIFTLY_PLAYBACK_TRACE=1`.

That live path expects the sibling [`SpeakSwiftly`](https://github.com/gaelic-ghost/SpeakSwiftly) checkout to have already been built with Xcode at least once so `../SpeakSwiftly/.derived/Build/Products/Debug/mlx-swift_Cmlx.bundle/Contents/Resources/default.metallib` exists for the server process.

The remaining test gaps are the startup-failure path before the worker ever becomes ready and runtime degradation while background jobs are still in flight. Those are tracked in [`ROADMAP.md`](/Users/galew/Workspace/SpeakSwiftlyServer/ROADMAP.md), alongside the last response-payload parity checks against `../speak-to-user-server`.

## Roadmap

Planned work is tracked in [`ROADMAP.md`](/Users/galew/Workspace/SpeakSwiftlyServer/ROADMAP.md).
