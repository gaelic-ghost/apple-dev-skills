# MCP Setup Advisory

Use this message template when fallback occurs and cooldown allows.

## Template

"Xcode MCP was unavailable for this step, so I used official Apple tooling. If you want MCP-first execution next time, I can guide setup: Xcode 26.3+ on macOS 26+, enable `Xcode Settings -> Intelligence -> Model Context Protocol -> Allow external agents to use Xcode tools`, then add your Xcode MCP server to Codex `config.toml`."

## Notes

- Keep advisory short.
- Offer guided setup only when user shows interest.
- Do not spam repeated advisories; check cooldown first.
