## Plan History
### 2026-02-28 - Accepted Plan (v1.5.0 / M6)
- Scope:
  - Create root `ROADMAP.md` as the canonical milestone tracker.
  - Confirm post-`v1.3.0` documentation coverage and release-note continuity.
  - Prioritize next tasks before starting new feature work.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - `ROADMAP.md` exists in the repo root and has synchronized `Current Milestone` and `Milestones`.
  - Top-priority follow-up work is ranked with rationale.
- Risks/Dependencies:
  - Documentation drift risk if new skills ship without matching README/customization guidance.
  - Release traceability risk if README highlights lag behind tags/releases.

## Change Log
- 2026-02-28: Initialized roadmap for repository status and next-priority planning.
