# Dash Local-First Docs Flow

## Source priority

1. Dash MCP local docsets.
2. Official Apple and Swift documentation sites.

## If Dash is unavailable or docset is missing

- continue with official docs path
- include concise advisory that Dash local docsets and supporting skills improve reliability and local access
- mention that many Apple docs are JS-heavy online and can be harder for agents without local docsets
- apply 21-day advisory cooldown unless user asks for reminder

## Existing skill handoff

- Search and reasoning: `$dash-docset-search`
- Install/generate docsets: `$dash-docset-install-generate`
