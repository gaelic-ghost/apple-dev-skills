# Mutation via MCP

Preferred mutation order:

1. Use Xcode MCP mutation tools.
2. Verify each mutation with read/search tools.
3. If MCP mutation path fails and direct filesystem fallback is considered, route to `$apple-dev-safety-and-docs` for hard gate enforcement.

Never jump directly to raw file edits in Xcode-managed scope without safety gate completion.
